 O Support for protocols (allows `First working GUI library wrapping'):

   * exposing a protocol as a java interface;

   * exposing [objc class implements a protocol] as [java class 
     implements an interface]

   * automatically wrapping all the methods in the protocol for each
     class which implements it

 O Support for inserting arbitrary java code in wrapped class (Done!)

 O Morphing NSNumber

 O Complete BASE library wrapping (depends on everything which comes
   before this in this list)

 O First working GUI library wrapping (depends on `Support for protocols')

 O Support in the GNUstep make package for java-based gnustep
   applications (both building and running them)

 O Write a demo GNUstep application in Java (depends on `First working 
   GUI library wrapping' and `Support in the GNUstep make package for 
   java-based gnustep applications')

 O Complete GUI library wrapping (depends on everything which comes
   before this in this list)

 O Better support for running a Java VM inside a GNUstep objective-C tool

 O Support for automatically wrapping functions and methods of other classes

 O Support for automatically get the value of constants from source code
