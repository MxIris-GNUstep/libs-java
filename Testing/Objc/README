SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
===================

Should work out of the box on Sun's JDK 1.2.2 and Sun's JDK 1.3.0.  It
should not be difficult to port to other platforms; just figure out
the flags for your Java platform, and send them to me
(n.pero@mi.flashnet.it) so I can include them in next release of these
files.  You need to figure out which libraries you need to link
against in order to start a Java virtual machine on your platform.  A
good start could be to look at the `java' or `java_vm' executable, run
`ldd' on it, and spy the libraries used in that executable.


INSTRUCTIONS
============

1. Source the GNUstep-Java.sh script

Before playing with this, you need to source the GNUstep-Java.sh
script which you find in this directory:

. ./GNUstep-Java.sh

The script will set up your library path so that the linker can find
your Java libraries.

2. Compile

Type `make'.

3. Run the script from the command line

./obj/JavaTest
