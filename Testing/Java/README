These tests are meant to test the gnustep-base and gnustep-gui library 
wrappers.  So, before trying these tests, you obviously need to install 
the base and gui library wrappers :) 

To compile the tests, type 'make'.
To run them, do as in the following example:

  java NSObjectTest 

Or, if you don't have ./ in your CLASSPATH, 

  CLASSPATH=./:$CLASSPATH java NSObjectTest

If you encounter problems (crashes) loading libraries, 
try running the script ld_lib_path.sh before running 
the tests.  For example, I do: 

. /opt/gnustep/System/Makefiles/ld_lib_path.sh
