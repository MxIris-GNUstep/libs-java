These tests are meant to benchmark the gnustep-base library wrappers.  So,
before trying these benchmarks, you obviously need to install the base
library wrappers :)

To compile the tests, type 'make'.  To run all of them, type 'make
benchmark'.  This should not only warn you that accessing ObjC objects from
Java is considerably slower than normal Java operations (except string
manipulations and anything involving string manipulations), but should
possibly give you an idea of the order of magnitude of the various
operations.

If you encounter problems (crashes) loading libraries, try running the
script GNUstep.sh before running the tests.  For example, I do:

. /opt/gnustep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
