These tests are meant to test the gnustep-base library wrappers.  So,
before trying these tests, you obviously need to install the base
library wrappers :)

To compile the tests, type 'make'.  To run all of them in a sort of
automated fashion, type 'make check'.

To run them singularly, do as in the following example:

  java NSObjectTest 

Or, if you don't have ./ in your CLASSPATH, 

  CLASSPATH=./:$CLASSPATH java NSObjectTest

If you encounter problems (crashes) loading libraries, 
try running the script ld_lib_path.sh before running 
the tests.  For example, I do: 

. /opt/gnustep/System/Makefiles/ld_lib_path.sh
