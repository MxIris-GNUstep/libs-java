4.9 Including Special Code in the Wrapper GNUmakefiles
</H1>

<P>
This section describes a feature which is usually not needed, so you
may skip it at a first reading.  As a prerequisite, you probably need
to have read the section <A HREF="node12.html#wrapper-structure">4.1.2</A> to make any use of
this section.

<P>
It is possible that you may need/want to insert special code in the
GNUmakefile.preamble and GNUmakefile.postamble for the wrappers.  For
example, some special flags required to compile an Objective-C library
(the Objective-C wrapper library for your library) against your
Objective-C library.

<P>
JIGS itself by default does not generate GNUmakefile.preamble and
GNUmakefile.postamble at all; but it will look in the library
directory for the files 
<PRE>
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.preamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.postamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.java.preamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.java.postamble
</PRE>
and, if any of them is present, copy them into the <TT>JavaWrapper</TT> 
directory, in the following way:
<PRE>
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.preamble --&gt; JavaWrapper/Objc/GNUmakefile.preamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.postamble --&gt; JavaWrapper/Objc/GNUmakefile.postamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.java.preamble --&gt; JavaWrapper/Java/GNUmakefile.preamble
GNUmakefile.wrapper.java.postamble --&gt; JavaWrapper/Java/GNUmakefile.postamble
</PRE>

<P>
In this way, by adding one of these files to your library's directory,
you can have it copied into the generated wrappers in the appropriate
place.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00591000000000000000">
4.9.1 Finding the library</A>
</H2>
A typical usage of this is to wrap libraries which have not yet been
installed.  Normally, you create java wrappers for libraries which you
have already installed.  Sometimes though, you need to create java
wrappers for a library before it is installed.  In this case, you
might need to help the compiler to find your actual library when it
links the java wrappers.

<P>
You would do so by creating a file called
<PRE>
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.postamble
</PRE>
and adding to this file something like the following line
<PRE>
ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS = -L/opt/nicola/MyLibrary/
</PRE>
Please note that you will need to install your library anyway before
you can use the java wrappers, because the library must be found at
run-time as well!

<P>
A classical case in which you need this trick is if you are building
the java wrappers with the library itself (that is, if you have a
<TT>GNUmakefile</TT> which includes both <TT>library.make</TT> and
<TT>java-wrapper.make</TT> and which you use to compile both.  In that
case, you need to add
<PRE>
ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS = -L../../$(GNUSTEP_OBJ_DIR)
</PRE>
to your <TT>GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.preamble</TT> to make sure that,
when the java wrappers are built, the compiler will find the original
library (and you also need to make sure that <TT>library.make</TT> is
included before <TT>java-wrapper.make</TT> so that the library is
compiled before the wrappers.
