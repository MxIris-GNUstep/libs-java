<DD>Please note that this
is completely consistent with C, where <TT>NSPoint</TT> is a struct,
which is passed to the called function by value - the Objective-C
function/method can not modify the original
<TT>NSPoint</TT> argument, because it is only given a local copy of
it.  This works from Java in the same way: you pass to your method a
Java <TT>NSPoint</TT> object as the argument; the method will not
modify it.  This is an important point if you want to compare JIGS
with Apple's Java Bridge.  Recent releases of Apple's OPENSTEP-like
environment add a flock of new C types to their Foundation library -
namely, <TT>NSPointPointer</TT>, <TT>NSSizePointer</TT>,
<TT>NSRectPointer</TT>, <TT>NSRangePointer</TT>, <TT>NSPointArray</TT>, 
<TT>NSSizeArray</TT>, <TT>NSRectArray</TT> and <TT>NSRangeArray</TT>  
- which are then all mapped in a different way to Java;
correspondingly, they have different Java classes (for example they
have <TT>NSMutablePoint</TT>, corresponding to their new C type
<TT>NSPointPointer</TT>).  GNUstep will possibly have these C types 
for compatibility with Apple, but their use is discouraged, and the
same must be said for future implementation of <TT>NSMutablePoint</TT>
and similar.  JIGS's wrapping of <TT>NSPoint</TT> has been designed to
be as easy, intuitive and fast as possible - and in the spirit of the
original OPENSTEP design/specification.

<DD>The
Apple Java Bridge has the same memory management problem, but it does
not provide this method, so on their platform the Java programmer has
to use a hack (an auxiliary array) to deal with it.
