<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00551000000000000000">
4.5.1 Determining which .jigs file to read</A>
</H2>
After running the preprocessor on the header file, JIGS will read a
configuration file to know which wrappers to generate, and how.  By
default, the file is called <TT>$(LIBRARY_NAME).jigs</TT>.  In the
case described before, this file would be called
<TT>libGame.jigs</TT>.  You can override this choice by setting the
<TT>JIGS_FILE</TT> variable in your <TT>GNUmakefile.wrapper</TT>, 
but you shouldn't usually need to.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00552000000000000000">
4.5.2 Overview of the .jigs file</A>
</H2>
The <TT>.jigs</TT> file is the main file from which you can control
the way the wrapping is done.  In this file, you need to list all the
classes of your library which you want to expose, and for each class,
which methods.  The <TT>.jigs</TT> file is in a format called 
<I>property list</I> - please refer to the GNUstep Base Library tutorials 
and documentation if you need more help on property lists.  The
<TT>.jigs</TT> file is a big dictionary.  Each entry in the dictionary 
is to be thought of as of a different section; the key to the section
is the section name, the value is an array or a dictionary containing
the information referring to that section.  For example, we have the
<TT>classes</TT> section (containing an array of classes to be wrapped), the
<TT>types</TT> section (containing a dictionary of mapping of custom C 
types to already known C types), the <TT>enumerations</TT> section
(containing an array listing enumeration types), the <TT>method
name mapping</TT> section (containing a dictionary of mappings from
objective-C method names to Java method names, to be used for the
whole library).  Here is an example:
<PRE>
{
  classes = (
    {
      "java name" = "gnu.gnustep.GreatGameLibrary.GGLSprite";
      "objective-c name" = GGLSprite;
      "instance methods" = (speed, "setSpeed:");
      initializers = (init);
     }
   );
  
  "method name mapping" = {
    speed = getSpeed;
  };
}
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, we only have the <TT>classes</TT> and <TT>method
name mapping</TT> sections.  We now examine in detail each section of the
<TT>.jigs</TT> file.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00553000000000000000">
4.5.3 The Classes Section</A>
</H2>
Probably the most important section in the file is the
<TT>classes</TT> section, where you list all the classes you want to
be wrapped, and how.  This section is an array, each entry in the
array being a different class to be wrapped.  Here is an example 
of this section:
<PRE>
classes = (
  {
    "java name" = "gnu.gnustep.GreatGameLibrary.GGLScore";
    "objective-c name" = "GGLScore";

    "initializers" = ("init"); 
    "instance methods" = ("setPoints:", "points");
    "class methods" = ("bestScore", "bestTenScores");
  },

  {
    "java name" = "gnu.gnustep.GreatGameLibrary.GGLPlayer";
    "objective-c name" = "GGLPlayer";

    "class methods" = ("computerPlayer");
    "instance methods" = ("name", "score", "addPoints:");
    "initializers" = ("init", "initWithName:");                 
  }
);
</PRE>
In this example, we want to generate wrappers for two classes:
<TT>GGLScore</TT> and <TT>GGLPlayer</TT>.  Information about each 
class is represented by a dictionary.  Any entry in this dictionary
(except the `<TT>java name</TT>' entry) can be omitted, in which case
a default value will be used.  We briefly now review the use of each
entry.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553100000000000000">
4.5.3.1 java name</A>
</H3>
This is a string - the name that is to be used in Java for the class
you want to wrap.  This is the only compulsory entry for each class.
You need to specify the full Java name of the class, such as
<PRE>
"java name" = "gnu.gnustep.base.NSArray";
</PRE>
You can decide to use a different name in Java than the name the class
has in Objective-C.  It's generally better to avoid this, but it
should work fine if you ever need to do it.  

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553200000000000000">
4.5.3.2 objective-c name</A>
</H3>
This is a string - the Objective-C name of the class you want to
wrap, such as 
<PRE>
"objective-c name" = "NSArray";
</PRE>
If this entry is not present, it is guessed by taking the last part of
<TT>java name</TT>.  For example, if <TT>java name</TT> is 
<TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSArray</TT>, then JIGS will use <TT>NSArray</TT> 
as Objective-C name if you don't specify an Objective-C name.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553300000000000000">
4.5.3.3 initializers</A>
</H3>
This is an array - the list of <TT>init</TT> methods you want to
wrap, such as
<PRE>
"initializers" = ("init", "initWithName:", "initWithArray:", "initWithName:array:");
</PRE>
Each method in the <TT>initializers</TT> list will be exposed as a
constructor.  The Objective-C name of each initializer is discarded 
in Java, so you must make sure that these methods have all different 
signatures.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553400000000000000">
4.5.3.4 class methods</A>
</H3>
This is an array - the list of class methods you want to wrap, such as 
<PRE>
"class methods" = (
  "contentRectForFrameRect:styleMask:", 
  "frameRectForContentRect:styleMask:", 
  "minFrameWidthWithTitle:styleMask:",
  "removeFrameUsingName:");
</PRE>
Each of these methods is exposed as a static method in Java.  Unless
you use a method mapping (explained below), the Java name of each of
these methods will be obtained by removing from the Objective-C name
everything which comes after the first `<TT>:</TT>'.  For example, the
methods in the example would be wrapped as:
<PRE>
public static native NSRect contentRectForFrameRect (NSRect arg0, long arg1);
public static native NSRect frameRectForContentRect (NSRect arg0, long arg1);
public static native NSRect minFrameWidthWithTitle (String arg0, long arg1);
public static native void removeFrameUsingName (String arg0);
</PRE>

<P>
Please make sure you do not include any methods of the <TT>new</TT>
family in the <TT>class methods</TT> list.  <TT>new</TT> methods can not
be wrapped because they allocate and return non-autoreleased objects
- it should not be a problem anyway, because if you need that
constructor in Java, you can get it by simply wrapping the
corresponding <TT>init</TT> method.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553500000000000000">
4.5.3.5 instance methods</A>
</H3>
This is an array - the list of instance methods you want to wrap,
such as 
<PRE>
"instance methods" = (
  "arguments",
  "environment",
  "hostName",
  "processName",
  "globallyUniqueString",
  "setProcessName:");
</PRE>
Each of these methods is exposed as an instance method in Java.  The
Java names for these methods are obtained in the same way as for class
methods.

<P>
Make sure you do not include any method of the <TT>copy</TT> and 
<TT>mutableCopy</TT> family in this list.  Methods of these families 
can not be wrapped like the other ones because they return
newly-created non-autoreleased objects.  It is possible that in the
future JIGS could provide a way to expose these methods; at present,
you can not expose them - except the ones exposed by <TT>NSObject</TT>: 
<TT>NSObject</TT> exposes <TT>copy</TT> (as <TT>clone</TT>) and 
<TT>mutableCopy</TT> (as <TT>mutableClone</TT>) to Java, so if your 
Objective-C class implements <TT>copy</TT> and <TT>mutableCopy</TT>,
they will automatically be made available to Java by the
<TT>NSObject</TT> wrapper without any need to do anything.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553600000000000000">
4.5.3.6 method declarations</A>
</H3>
This is an array - a list of explicit method declarations which you
can use to override the declarations found by the wrapper tool in the
header file if you think the wrapper tool did not use the correct
declaration - this usually happens only if in your library the same
method is declared in different classes or protocols with different
arguments or return types (this case is infrequent, but it happens
sometime) - in this case the wrapper tool is likely not to pick up
the correct declaration, because it is designed for the standard case,
when the same signature is used across all classes.  By adding the
correct declaration for your class in the <TT>method declaration</TT>
section, you can make sure that the declaration you want is used.  For
example, in the gui library the following explicit declaration is used
when wrapping
<TT>NSBox</TT>:
<PRE>
"method declarations" = (
   "- (void) setContentView: (NSView*)aView");
</PRE>
This is because <TT>NSScrollView</TT> uses a conflicting declaration
for this method, taking a <TT>NSClipView *</TT> argument.

<P>
Please note that, while in Objective-C these problems are harmless,
and usually the worst it can happen is that the compiler warns you at
compile time, after you expose your methods to Java these problems
become first-rate problems, because in Java casts are dramatic and
your program can crash if a method expecting a <TT>NSClipView</TT>
argument receives a generic <TT>NSView</TT> instead.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553700000000000000">
4.5.3.7 hardcoded constants</A>
</H3>
This is an array - a list of declaration of constants which will be
added as static constants to the Java class, as in the following
example:
<PRE>
"hardcoded constants" = ("int NotFound = 0x7fffffff");
</PRE>
This <TT>hardcoded constants</TT> section will generate the following
code in the Java class:
<PRE>
public static int NotFound = 0x7fffffff;
</PRE>
This example is taken from the wrapping instructions for
<TT>NSArray</TT>; it allows the Java programmer to access this
constant simply as <TT>NSArray.NotFound</TT>.  The value of this
constant is of course the value of the C constant <TT>NSNotFound</TT>
which is returned by many GNUstep Base Library methods when something
is not found.

<P>
If your Objective-C library defines some constants, and some methods
which you expose to Java return or accept these constants, you may
want to make these constants available to Java as well by using the
<TT>hardcoded constants</TT> section.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553800000000000000">
4.5.3.8 file to include in java code</A>
</H3>
This is a string - a filename (relative to the current directory).
When WrapCreator generates the Java class, it will read the contents
of this file, and add them - without any change - inside the Java
class.

<P>
For example, to insert a Java method of your own into the generated 
Java wrapper class, you could use the following entry:
<PRE>
"file to include in java code" = "MyClass.java.add";
</PRE>
Then, you need to put the Java code you want to add into the file
<TT>MyClass.java.add</TT>.  Here is a trivial example:
<PRE>
  /**
    * Returns the sum of the arguments.
    */
  public int test (int a, int b)
  {
    return a + b;
  }
</PRE>
This code would be inserted <EM>inside</EM> the Java class implementation 
when the Java wrapper is created.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00553900000000000000">
4.5.3.9 file to include in preamble java code</A>
</H3>
This is a string - a filename (relative to the current directory).
The only difference with <TT>file to include in java code</TT>
(described above) is that in this case the code is included <EM>before</EM> the Java class, between the <TT>import</TT> statements and the
class implementation, rather than <EM>inside</EM> the class
implementation.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION005531000000000000000">
4.5.3.10 file to include in objective-c code</A>
</H3>
This is a string - a filename (relative to the current directory).
When WrapCreator generates the Objective-C code, it will read the
contents of this file, and add them - without any change - at the
end of the Objective-C file for that class.  In this way, you can add
arbitrary functions and C or Objective-C code to the wrapper library.

<P>
The combination of this feature with the one to include arbitrary java
code into the wrapper allows you to add hand-made wrapped methods to
the java wrapper.  This is a very advanced feature and is not
documented here.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00554000000000000000">
4.5.4 Method Name Mapping</A>
</H2>
This section is a dictionary - mapping Objective-C method names 
to Java method names, as in the following example:
<PRE>
"method name mapping" = {
  "null" = "nullValue";
  "addTimer:forMode:" = "addTimerForMode";
};
</PRE>
Try to avoid method mappings, because they are confusing!  But
sometimes you can't do without, as in the case of <TT>null</TT> which
can't be exposed with this name to Java because <TT>null</TT> is a
reserved keyword in Java.  In this case, you use the method mapping.
Please note that JIGS needs to keep a global table of method name
mappings while running in order to map selectors between Java and
Objective-C; for this reason, you need to use the same mappings in all
the classes.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00555000000000000000">
4.5.5 Prerequisite Libraries</A>
</H2>
Sometimes, the wrappers for your library need the wrappers of some
other GNUstep Objective-C library to work correctly.  For example, you
can't use the wrappers for the GNUstep Gui Library without the
wrappers for the GNUstep Base Library.  If this is the case for your
library, you need to add a <TT>prerequisite libraries</TT> section,
containing a list of GNUstep libraries whose wrappers you want to be
loaded at run-time when the wrappers for your library are initialized.
For example, in <TT>libgnustep-gui.jigs</TT> there is
<PRE>
"prerequisite libraries" = ("gnustep-base");
</PRE>
You will probably usually need at least this line.  Please note that
the library is specified using the simplest possible name; JIGS at
run-time will add the correct prefixes (<TT>lib</TT>) and suffixes
(things like <TT>_d</TT> for debug version - if needed - and
<TT>.A</TT> for the wrappers) to load in the library.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00556000000000000000">
4.5.6 Types</A>
</H2>
The wrapper tool can parse and manage a certain set of C types.  For
example, upon finding <TT>BOOL</TT> in the Objective-C headers, the
wrapper tool knows how to manage it.

<P>
In the <TT>types</TT> section you can specify a list of C types
specific to your library, and for each of them, a corresponding
(known) C type.  The wrapper tool will know it has to convert to/from
Java the first C type in the same way as it does with the second.  For
example, in the <TT>libgnustep-base.jigs</TT> file, there is the
following line:
<PRE>
types = { NSTimeInterval = double; };
</PRE>
This simply tells to the wrapper tool that whenever it finds an argument 
of type <TT>NSTimeInterval</TT> in an Objective-C method declaration, it 
has to treat it in the same way as if it were a <TT>double</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00557000000000000000">
4.5.7 Enumerations</A>
</H2>
The <TT>enumerations</TT> section is simply a short-hand to make
wrapping enumerations simpler.  This section contains an array, in
which you can list all the new enumeration types in your Objective-C
library that you want to be exposed:
<PRE>
enumerations = (NSTitlePosition);
</PRE>
The enumeration types are exposed in the same way as <TT>int</TT>s
are.  In other words, this is completely equivalent to putting
<TT>NSTitlePosition</TT> in the <TT>types</TT> section mapping it to
the <TT>int</TT> type:
<PRE>
types = { NSTitlePosition = int; };
</PRE>
Using the <TT>enumerations</TT> section rather than mixing
enumerations with the other types makes simply the wrapping file
clearer to read, and lets you type less.

<P>
Usually, after declaring an enumeration in the <TT>enumerations</TT> 
section, you need to add the various values as hardcoded constants 
in one of your Java classes.  For example, in the GNUstep Gui 
Library, after having declared <TT>NSTitlePosition</TT> as an 
enumeration, the following entry is added to the <TT>NSBox</TT> 
class entry:
<PRE>
"hardcoded constants" = (
   "int NoTitle = 0",
   "int AboveTop = 1",
   "int AtTop = 2",
   "int BelowTop = 3",
   "int AboveBottom = 4",
   "int AtBottom = 5",
   "int BelowBottom = 6");
</PRE>
This will generate the following code in the Java <TT>NSBox</TT> class:
<PRE>
/* Constants */

public static int NoTitle = 0;
public static int AboveTop = 1;
public static int AtTop = 2;
public static int BelowTop = 3;
public static int AboveBottom = 4;
public static int AtBottom = 5;
public static int BelowBottom = 6;
</PRE>
This makes sure the various values for <TT>NSTitlePosition</TT>
arguments are available from Java quite simply as <TT>NSBox.NoTitle</TT> 
etc.
