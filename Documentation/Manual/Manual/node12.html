4.1 Compiling ready-to-use wrappers</A>
</H1>

<P>
We start by reviewing the simplest case: you have a library installed
on your system, and you download the wrappers for that library.  The
wrappers actually consist of a <TT>GNUmakefile</TT>, a <TT>.jigs</TT>
file, and possibly a few other support files.  These files contain all
the instructions JIGS needs to wrap your library.  You can try the
discussion out by using any example in the
<TT>Tools/WrapCreator/Examples/</TT> directory (which are slightly
more complicated, as the library and the wrapper for the library are
kept and compiled in the same directory at the same time).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00511000000000000000">
4.1.1 Creating and compiling the wrappers</A>
</H2>

<P>
When you type <TT>make</TT>, JIGS will automatically create a
directory called
<PRE>
JavaWrapper
</PRE>
and generate inside this directory source code for the wrappers.  It
will then enter into this directory, and compile the wrapper source
code (which has just been generated).  If you want more details about
the wrapping process (which classes and which methods are being
wrapped), you can use
<PRE>
make verbose=yes
</PRE>

<P>
To access your library from Java you need to have compiled and
installed both the original library and the wrappers.

<P>
Typing <TT>make install</TT> will install the wrappers, so you should
be ready to use them from Java.

4.1.2 Structure of the wrappers
</H2>

<P>
It's not strictly necessary for you to know the structure of the
wrappers to create or use them, so you may safely skip this section.

<P>
In the following discussion, we consider wrappers for an imaginary
library called <TT>libexample.so</TT>.

<P>
The wrappers for the library are composed of two parts: a set of Java
classes, and a native Objective-C library, called
<TT>libexample.A.so</TT> in the example.  This is called after the 
original library (<TT>libexample.so</TT>) with a <TT>.A</TT> appended
to the name.

<P>
If you go into the <TT>JavaWrapper</TT> directory, you can inspect
these parts yourself.  There are two main subdirectories in the
<TT>JavaWrapper</TT> directory, the <TT>Java</TT> and the
<TT>Objc</TT> subdirectories.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00512100000000000000">
4.1.2.1 The Java subdirectory</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Java</TT> subdirectory contains the Java classes.  All methods
which are not explicitly marked as <TT>public</TT> in these classes
are to be considered internal to the JIGS engine and you should not
access them directly (you probably will not be allowed to anyway).

<P>
All these classes contain a static initializer of the following form:
<PRE>
 static
  {
    JIGS.loadLibrary ("example.A");
  }
</PRE>
This will load the native library <TT>libexample.A.so</TT> as soon as
the first Java class is accessed (<TT>libexample.A.so</TT> will
implicitly load <TT>libexample.so</TT>).

<P>
Then, most methods are <TT>native</TT>, as in the following example: 
<PRE>
 /**
   * Wraps the Objective-C method
   * &lt;B&gt;start&lt;/B&gt;
   */
  public native void start ();
</PRE>

<P>
The implementation of the Java methods marked as <TT>native</TT> will
be found by the JVM inside the native library <TT>libexample.A.so</TT>
(see next section).

<P>
As it is shown in the example, each class and public method has a tiny
minimal javadoc description.  When the java classes are compiled,
quick reference documentation for the classes will be generated from
these comments by using javadoc, and put into the subdirectory
<TT>Reference</TT>.  This documentation is minimal, and basically
consists in the list of all Java wrapper classes and methods which
were compiled, and for each one, a comment explaining which
Objective-C class or method it wraps.  While minimal, this
documentation can be quite useful for someone already knowing the
Objective-C API (or having the Objective-C documentation to refer to)
and wanting to use the library from Java.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00512200000000000000">
4.1.2.2 The Objc subdirectory</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Objc</TT> subdirectory contains the Objective-C library 
<TT>libexample.A.so</TT>, which provides to Java the implementation 
of all the <TT>native</TT> methods in the Java classes.  The
implementation of these methods will call the corresponding methods in
the (pure Objective-C) <TT>libexample.so</TT> library, by using the
JIGS core engine to catch exceptions, convert arguments and return
types, etc.
