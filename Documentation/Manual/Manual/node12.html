4.1 Compiling the Wrappers of an Already Configured Library</A>
</H1>
We start by reviewing the simplest case: you download the source code
of a library which is already configured to generate java wrappers
when it is compiled.  You can try the discussion out by using any
example in the <TT>Tools/WrapCreator/Examples/</TT> directory.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00511000000000000000">
4.1.1 Creating and Compiling the Wrappers</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this case, when you type <TT>make</TT>, the Objective-C will be
compiled as usual; after it is compiled, JIGS will automatically
create a directory called <TT>JavaWrapper</TT> (or
<TT>JavaWrapper_debug</TT> if you are compiling with debug enabled),
and generate inside this directory source code for the wrappers.  It
will then enter into this directory, and compile the wrapper source
code (which has just been generated).

<P>
It is quite important to understand that at this point you have two
different entities: the original Objective-C library, and the Java
wrappers for this library.  While the default JIGS setup is to manage
all automatically for you, the two things can be compiled and
installed separately.  To access your library from Objective-C you
only need to have compiled and installed your original library, while
to access it from Java you need to have compiled and installed both
the original library and the wrappers.

<P>
In the default setup, when you install the library, JIGS automatically
installs the wrapper library too.

4.1.2 Structure of the Wrappers
</H2>

<P>
It's not strictly necessary for you to know the structure of the
wrappers to create or use them, so you may safely skip this section.

<P>
In the following discussion, we consider wrappers for an imaginary
library called <TT>libexample.so</TT>.

<P>
The wrappers for the library are composed of two parts: a set of Java
classes, and a native Objective-C library, called
<TT>libexample.A.so</TT> in the example.  This is called after the 
original library (<TT>libexample.so</TT>) with a <TT>.A</TT> appended
to the name.

<P>
If you go into the <TT>JavaWrapper</TT> directory, you can inspect
these parts yourself.  There are two main subdirectories in the
<TT>JavaWrapper</TT> directory, the <TT>Java</TT> and the
<TT>Objc</TT> subdirectories.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00512100000000000000">
4.1.2.1 The Java Subdirectory</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Java</TT> subdirectory contains the Java classes.  All methods
which are not explicitly marked as <TT>public</TT> in these classes
are to be considered internal to the JIGS engine and you should not
access them directly (you probably will not be allowed to anyway).

<P>
All these classes contain a static initializer of the following form:
<PRE>
 static
  {
    JIGS.loadLibrary ("example.A");
  }
</PRE>
This will load the native library <TT>libexample.A.so</TT> as soon as
the first Java class is accessed (<TT>libexample.A.so</TT> will
implicitly load <TT>libexample.so</TT>).

<P>
Then, most methods are <TT>native</TT>, as in the following example: 
<PRE>
 /**
   * Wraps the Objective-C method
   * &lt;B&gt;start&lt;/B&gt;
   */
  public native void start ();
</PRE>

<P>
The implementation of the Java methods marked as <TT>native</TT> will
be found by the JVM inside the native library <TT>libexample.A.so</TT>
(see next section).

<P>
As it is shown in the example, each class and public method has a tiny
minimal javadoc description.  When the java classes are compiled,
quick reference documentation for the classes will be generated from
these comments by using javadoc, and put into the subdirectory
<TT>Reference</TT>.  This documentation is minimal, and basically
consists in the list of all Java wrapper classes and methods which
were compiled, and for each one, a comment explaining which
Objective-C class or method it wraps.  While minimal, this
documentation can be quite useful for someone already knowing the
Objective-C API (or having the Objective-C documentation to refer to)
and wanting to use the library from Java.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00512200000000000000">
4.1.2.2 The Objc Subdirectory</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Objc</TT> subdirectory contains the Objective-C library 
<TT>libexample.A.so</TT>, which provides to Java the implementation 
of all the <TT>native</TT> methods in the Java classes.  The
implementation of these methods will call the corresponding methods in
the (pure Objective-C) <TT>libexample.so</TT> library, by using the
JIGS core engine to catch exceptions, convert arguments and return
types, etc.
