4.8 Useful Make Options when Creating Wrappers</A>
</H1>

<P>
At this point, typing <TT>make</TT> should be enough to generate
wrappers for your library.  

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00581000000000000000">
4.8.1 Silencing the Wrapper Generator</A>
</H2>

<P>
By default, wrapper generation is quite verbose - it tells you
exactly what it is doing - for example, it lists all the classes and
methods which are being wrapped.  If you find this annoying, you can
turn it off by compiling with the <TT>verbose=no</TT> option, as in:
<PRE>
make verbose=no
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00582000000000000000">
4.8.2 Enabling Debugging</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you are compiling your library with debugging enabled  - ie, typing
<PRE>
make debug=yes
</PRE>
the wrapper library will also be generated with debugging enabled.
This means that the GNUmakefiles for the wrapping library will
always automatically use <TT>debug=yes</TT> when the wrapping library
is compiled.  The wrapping code itself will be generated in the
<TT>JavaWrapper_debug</TT> directory rather than in the <TT>JavaWrapper</TT>, 
to allow you to keep the two versions.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00583000000000000000">
4.8.3 Debugging or Non-Debugging</A>
</H2>

<P>
When Objective-C GNUstep libraries are loaded from Java using JIGS,
all the libraries must be of the same type - or debugging libraries
or non-debugging libraries.  

<P>
In general, the simplest way you can manage this issue is by
consistently using only libraries of one of the two kind on your
system; ie, compile everything (from the GNUstep Base Library up) with
`<TT>make</TT>', or compile everything with `<TT>make debug=yes</TT>'.

<P>
If you don't, then you need to read carefully the following part.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00583100000000000000">
4.8.3.1 The Fine Prints About Debugging</A>
</H3>

<P>
JIGS will decide whether to use debugging or non-debugging libraries
at run-time, when it is first initialized from Java.  Debugging
libraries are easy to tell because the name ends with <TT>_d</TT>.
For example, the core JIGS library is
<TT>libgnustep-java</TT>; if you compile it without debugging, it will 
be in the file 
<PRE>
libgnustep-java.so
</PRE>
but if you compile it with debugging, it will be in the file 
<PRE>
libgnustep-java_d.so
</PRE>
Because the name is different, you can have both versions on your
system.  JIGS will choose to load debugging or non-debugging libraries
in the following way:

<OL>
<LI>If you have only one version of JIGS installed (ie, only the debugging 
or the non-debugging, but not both), there is no choice - JIGS will
load libraries of the same kind as itself.  This means if you have a
debugging version of JIGS installed, you will need to have a version
of all libraries you need with debugging enabled.  If you only have a
non-debugging version of JIGS installed, you will need to have a
version of all libraries you need without debugging.
</LI>
<LI>If you have both version of JIGS (the debugging and the non-debugging), 
JIGS will decide at run-time which version of itself to use (and
consequently, which version of all other libraries to use).  By
default, it will load the non-debugging version.  This is the default
because the idea is that using a debugger to debug libraries when
accessed from Java in this way is so difficult that most people will
not want to do it (I actually don't know how to do it myself).  But
you can override the default by setting the <TT>JIGS_DEBUG</TT>
environment variable.  Setting it to <TT>YES</TT> or <TT>yes</TT> will
give priority to the debugging libraries.
</LI>
</OL>
Once JIGS has chosen an option, it will follow it consistently.  For
example, if it decided to load debugging libraries, it will ignore all
non-debugging libraries.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00584000000000000000">
4.8.4 Turning off the Generation of Quick Reference Doc</A>
</H2>

<P>
To stop JIGS from automatically generating minimal javadoc comments
and the quick reference documentation from them, it's enough to
compile using <TT>javadoc=no</TT>, as in:
<PRE>
make javadoc=no
</PRE>
