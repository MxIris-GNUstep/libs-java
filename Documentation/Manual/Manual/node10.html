3.4.1 Weak References to Java Objects</A>
</H2>

<P>
Usually, when you pass a Java object as an argument to an Objective-C 
method, you do not need to do anything particular:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
NSMutableArray array = new NSMutableArray ();
FileReader nicola = new FileReader ("nicola");

array.addObject (nicola);
</PRE>
In this example (assuming the file <TT>nicola</TT> exists), we create
a java <TT>FileReader</TT> object, and then put it into a GNUstep
<TT>NSMutableArray</TT>.

<P>
This is the standard case - all works fine and out-of-the-box;
unfortunately, there is an exception.  The following methods need
special treatment to be used from Java:
<PRE>
public void setDelegate (Object delegate);
public void setTarget (Object target);
</PRE>
These methods are quite common in the GNUstep API, so it's quite
important that you know how to correctly call them.  These methods are
special, because the Objective-C implementation uses a special memory
management for the argument: it saves it as a weak reference rather
than a normal reference.  This is not a problem from Objective-C, but
in Java to use these methods you need to prepare the call by using the
method
<PRE>
public void retainObject (Object object);
</PRE>
provided by the <TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSObject</TT> class<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot411"><SUP>3.2</SUP></A>, as in the
following example:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
FileReader nicola = new FileReader ("nicola");
NSButton button = new NSButton ();

/* Retain object before calling setTarget */
NSObject.retainObject (nicola);

button.setTarget (nicola);
</PRE>
The example (setting a <TT>FileReader</TT> as the target of a
<TT>NSButton</TT>) is not necessarily meaningful, but it shows quite 
clearly how you should call <TT>setTarget</TT>.

<P>
In most cases, you use <TT>setTarget</TT> and <TT>setDelegate</TT>
only at the beginning, and then keep the target and delegate you have 
set for the whole life of you application.  In these cases, a single 
call to <TT>retainObject</TT> is enough.

<P>
In particular cases, you may want to change the target and delegate
during the lifetime of your application, or you may want to destroy
the object whose target (or delegate) you have set.  In these cases,
the single call to <TT>retainObject</TT> is enough to prevent your
application from crashing, but you will be leaking a little amount of
memory each time you change the target or delegate, or destroy an
object having a target or delegate set.  To stop this leaking, you
need to use <TT>releaseObject</TT> on the old target/delegate after
you have relieved it of its duty as target/delegate (or after you have
destroyed your object having it as its target/delegate).  In other 
words, you need to compensate each <TT>retainObject</TT> with a 
<TT>releaseObject</TT> call.

<P>
Here is a full example, in which we call <TT>setTarget</TT> to set
<TT>oldTarget</TT> as target, and then later we call it again to
change the target to be <TT>newTarget</TT>:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */

/* Set the old target */
NSObject.retainObject (oldTarget);
button.setTarget (oldTarget);

/* Do something else */

/* Many lines later... */

/* Set the new target */
NSObject.retainObject (newTarget);
button.setTarget (newTarget);

/* Balance the retain you did of the old target */
NSObject.releaseObject (oldTarget);
</PRE>
This example is correct and leaks no memory; but hey - in some cases,
you don't remember what was the old target!  You can still get it from
the button before setting the new one:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */

Object old;

/* Get the old target */
old = button.target ();

/* Set the new target */
NSObject.retainObject (newTarget);
button.setTarget (newTarget);

/* Release the old target */
NSObject.releaseObject (old);
</PRE>

3.4.2 Selectors</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>Selectors</I> are a typical feature of the Objective-C language, and
are used quite often in the GNUstep API.  

<P>
For example, in Objective-C you can tell a button that, when it is
pressed, it needs to send a message with a certain name to a certain
object.  The crucial point is that in Objective-C you can dynamically
change indipendently both the object which is to receive the message
(and consequently its class) and the name of the message you want to
be sent to the object.  

<P>
A selector represents just this - a method with a certain name -
leaving unspecified the class the method belongs to.  In Objective-C
you can then ask (at runtime) to the libraries to know if a class
implements a certain selector, or if an object responds to the
selector (which happens if and only if its class implements the
method), and if it does, invoke it.  Selectors are used instead of
using directly method names so that the Objective-C runtime can keep
selector tables and heavily optimize this kind of operations.

<P>
JIGS <I>morphs</I> selectors to Java <TT>NSSelector</TT> objects.  This
means that you can create a selector in Java, as a <TT>NSSelector</TT>
object, and then pass it as an argument to methods which in
Objective-C would accept a <TT>SEL</TT> (the C type for a selector)
argument; and vice versa, methods returning a <TT>SEL</TT> in
Objective-C will return an <TT>NSSelector</TT> object in Java.

<P>
There is an important difference to learn here: in Objective-C, a
method is univocally identified by its name; in Java, different
methods can have the same name, and be distinguished only because they
have different argument types (overloaded methods).  Thus the correct
way of interpreting a selector in Java is as a method name and a list
of argument types.  When you create a Java <TT>NSSelector</TT> object,
you must specify both the Java name and the type of the arguments.
The JIGS core engine takes care of mapping selectors from Java to
Objective-C and vice versa, so that you use selectors on the Java side
by specifying both java name and argument types, and on the
Objective-C side by only specifying the objective-C name.  Where is
the trick ?  Well, don't forget that Objective-C method names are
longer than Java method names - in Objective-C a method name has an
additional part for each argument - such as in
`<TT>writeToFile:atomically:</TT>', while in Java only the first part
of the name is used, such as in `<TT>writeToFile</TT>'.  To map the
Java method name to the full Objective-C name you need to know the
type of arguments - which in this case are a <TT>String</TT> and a
<TT>BOOL</TT>.  By knowing the argument type, the JIGS engine can find
out that the short Java name <TT>writeToFile</TT> has to be expanded
when crossing the interface to the long Objective-C name
<TT>writeToFile:atomically:</TT>.  This is why in Objective-C the name 
of the method (which has an additional string per parameter) is
enough, while in Java, where the name is very short and brief, you
need the argument types too.

<P>
We now make a complete example to make clear how selectors are used
from Java in practice.  We want to create a button from java, and have
it print out
<PRE>
Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti
</PRE>
when the user pushes it.  A full working example which you can compile
and run is in 
<PRE>
Testing/Java/NSButtonTest.java
</PRE>
here we only examine the parts related to selectors.

<P>
First of all, we implement the callback in a Java object: 
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
include java.lang.*;

class MyObject
{
  public MyObject () { }

  public void buttonPress (Object sender)
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
This is the method we want to be invoked when the button is pressed;
it is standard in GNUstep that such callback methods should take a
single object argument, which is the object which generated the
callback - so that in this case, when the user pushes the button, the
method <TT>buttonPress</TT> will be invoked with a single argument:
the (object representing the) button which was pressed.  If you have
more than one button all using the same action, this could be useful
to tell which button was pushed.

<P>
These callbacks are called <I>actions</I> in the GNUstep API.  So, we
have implemented the action that we want to be invoked when the button
is pressed.

<P>
Then (somewhere else) we create the button, 
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
 NSButton button;

 button = new NSButton ();
</PRE>
we create an object which implements the method <TT>buttonPress</TT>,
and set it as the <I>target</I> of the button - when the button is
pushed, the button tries to invoke the <I>action</I> on the
<I>target</I> object:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
 MyObject object = new MyObject (); 

 NSObject.retain (object);
 button.setTarget (object);
</PRE>
(why the call to <TT>retain</TT> is needed was explained in the
previous section), then we create a <TT>NSSelector</TT> object
representing the method we want to be invoked (more comments below),
and set it to be the button action:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
NSSelector selector;

selector = new NSSelector ("buttonPress", new Class[] {Object.class}));
button.setAction (selector);
</PRE>
And finally (just to make the example complete), we set the title of
the button, and make it of the correct size:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
button.setTitle ("Print Quote");
button.sizeToFit ();
</PRE>

<P>
As exemplified in the code, <TT>NSSelector</TT> has a single
constructor which should be used from Java, and it is:
<PRE>
 public NSSelector (String aMethodName, Class[] someParameterTypes);
</PRE>
The first argument is the name of the method (`<TT>buttonPress</TT>'
in our case), the second argument is a Java array of <TT>Class</TT>
objects representing the types of the method arguments.  In the
example, our method has a single argument, which must be an 
<TT>Object</TT>; and 
<PRE>
new Class [] {Object.class}
</PRE>
is the Java code to create a new array of <TT>Class</TT> objects
containing a single <TT>Object.class</TT> object - if this is
unclear, please refer to your Java documentation.

<P>
<B>FIXME</B>: Explain why in some circumstances selectors for class
methods are not safe to use from Java.

3.4.3 Subclassing GNUstep Objects in Java</A>
</H2>

<P>
Classes of GNUstep Libraries exposed to Java are Java classes in all
respects, so you can subclass them directly and simply.  

<P>
<TT>NSObject</TT> implements <TT>finalize ()</TT> to make some important 
cleanup - so if your <TT>NSObject</TT>'s subclass implements
<TT>finalize ()</TT>, you must call <TT>super.finalize ()</TT> 
at the end of your subclass implementation, as in the following template:
<PRE>
public void finalize ()
{
  /* Insert any cleanup specific to this class here */

  super.finalize ();
}
</PRE>

<P>
<B>WARNING</B>: This does not work yet (as of JIGS 0.9.3) if you pass
the object back to Objective-C.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00444000000000000000">
3.4.4 Using Java Threads</A>
</H2>

<P>
You can access GNUstep from multiple Java threads.  Make sure that the
GNUstep libraries you access are themselves thread-safe before trying
to use them in multithreading !  Otherwise you need to properly
synchronize access to the library facilities using the standard Java
synchronization support.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00444100000000000000">
3.4.4.1 The Fine Prints About Threads</A>
</H3>

<P>
This section gives you a rough idea of how threads work in JIGS.  You
may skip it at a first reading.

<P>
The first Java thread which accesses GNUstep will be registered as the
default Objective-C thread.  If this is the only thread you use to
access Objective-C, no other thread will be registered with
Objective-C, and GNUstep will happily go single-threaded.  But as soon
as you access GNUstep from a different thread, GNUstep will detect
that you are using a different thread, and switch to multi-threading
mode.  When multi-threading is enabled, the behaviour of JIGS is also
different: each time you call GNUstep, the thread is attached to
GNUstep, and detached when the call to GNUstep returns (unless it is
the default thread).  This is quite expensive - which implies that
your default Java thread (the first one you use to access GNUstep)
will access GNUstep much faster than other Java threads; and that - if
you are aiming at performance - multi-threaded code is not
necessarily going to be faster than single-threaded code.

<P>
In some rare cases, the default behaviour could not be appropriate for
your needs, and you could want to force GNUstep into multithreading
mode before you access it from a secondary thread.  The standard trick
to do this is to start an auxiliary Java thread, and run any GNUstep
command inside this thread.  The other solution is to call the method
<PRE>
  static native public void forceMultithreading ();
</PRE>
of the <TT>gnu.gnustep.java.JIGS</TT> class.  This is a GNUstep
extension which simply forces GNUstep into multithreading mode by
starting an auxiliary GNUstep thread.
