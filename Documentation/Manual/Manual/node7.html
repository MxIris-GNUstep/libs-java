<H2><A NAME="SECTION00411000000000000000">
3.1.1 Compiling a Single Class</A>
</H2>

<P>
Even without JIGS, the GNUstep make package has builtin support for
compilation of generic java projects.

<P>
As an example, consider the following java class: 
<PRE>
import java.lang.*;

class Pisa
{ 
  public static void printQuote ()
    throws Throwable
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
This class just prints out the famous quote by Dante about the Italian
city of Pisa; it makes only use of the standard java classes, so there
is no need to have JIGS to compile or run it.

<P>
Compiling this class can be quite easily done directly, but we want to
start learning how to use the GNUstep make package facilities for
java, so we write the following <TT>GNUmakefile</TT>:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = test
test_JAVA_FILES = Pisa.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>
The makefile is straightforward: the <TT>JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME</TT> is
just a name identifying the package (any name would do);
<TT>JAVA_FILES</TT> is a list of java files to be compiled.

<P>
You should now try to compile this java program by typing
<TT>make</TT>.  This - quite simply - compiles the java class.
What is more interesting is what happens when you type <TT>make
install</TT>: in this case, the java class is installed into
<TT>$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Libraries/Java/</TT>, which in my case means 
that the compiled class is installed into
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java/Pisa.class
</PRE>

<P>
Since the GNUstep initialization script - usually 
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
</PRE>
- adds <TT>/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java</TT> to the
<TT>CLASSPATH</TT>, after you have installed <TT>Pisa.class</TT>, you
can just access <TT>java Pisa</TT> from any Java program automatically.

<P>
This can be unfortunate, because if you install many different
classes, you end up with all the classes being installed in the same
big flat messy directory.  The java approach to this is to use
packages, an approach which is fully and simply supported by the
GNUstep make package.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00412000000000000000">
3.1.2 Compiling Classes Belonging to a Package</A>
</H2>

<P>
To organize our java classes better, we decide to create a new
package, called <TT>misc.quotes</TT>, and to make our class part of
it.  To do this, we rewrite our program as follows
<PRE>
package misc.quotes;

import java.lang.*;

class Pisa
{ 
  public static void printQuote ()
    throws Throwable
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
and we save it into the file 
<PRE>
misc/quotes/Pisa.java
</PRE>
This directory is relative to the position of the GNUmakefile, which
is where we will run the compiler.  We then rewrite our GNUmakefile to
be as follows:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = test
test_JAVA_FILES = misc/quotes/Pisa.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>
Typing <TT>make</TT> will compile the <TT>misc.quotes.Pisa</TT> class
as usual.

<P>
To include the class in other classes, we need now to always specify
the full package name, as in 
<PRE>
import misc.quotes.Pisa;
</PRE>

<P>
The GNUstep Make Package knows nothing about java packages; but, when
installing java class files, it preserves the relative path of the
classes, so that running <TT>make install</TT> will install
<TT>Pisa.class</TT> into
<PRE>
$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Libraries/Java/misc/quotes/
</PRE>
In my case, this means that it is installed into:
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java/misc/quotes/Pisa.class
</PRE>

<P>
Since the GNUstep make package does not really know about java
packages, it is perfectly correct to compile and install classes
belonging to different java packages with the same
<TT>GNUmakefile</TT>, as in the following example:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = fun
fun_JAVA_FILES = \
  misc/quotes/Pisa.java       \
  misc/quotes/Farinata.java   \
  misc/quotes/Ulisse.java     \
  misc/jokes/Sailor.java      \
  misc/jokes/Worker.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>

<P>
This will correctly compile and install the classes belonging to the
two different packages <TT>misc.quotes</TT> and <TT>misc.jokes</TT>;
please don't be confused by the <TT>JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME</TT> variable,
which bears no relation with java packages, and it is just a temporary
name used internally by the make package.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00413000000000000000">
3.1.3 Installing Java classes where you like</A>
</H2>

<P>
Compiled Java classes are automatically installed into
<PRE>
$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Libraries/Java/
</PRE>
and this makes sure that they are always in the classpath.  This is
what you normally want.

<P>
But sometimes you might need to modify this behaviour.  For example,
if you are writing Java servlets, you might want to install them in a
special, different place.  To do this, you may set the
<TT>JAVA_INSTALLATION_DIR</TT> variable in your makefile:

<P>
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = servlet
servlet_JAVA_FILES = MyServlet.java

JAVA_INSTALLATION_DIR = /usr/local/servlets

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>

<P>
This GNUmakefile will compile your servlet, and install it into 
<TT>/usr/local/servlets</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00414000000000000000">
3.1.4 Creating Java Tools</A>
</H2>

<P>
In GNUstep, a tool is a program which is run directly from the command
line.  The GNUstep make package 
(versions newer than 1.0.0) supports natively Java tools.

<P>
As an example, we now show how to turn our Pisa class into a Java
tool.  We modify the code to be:
<PRE>
import java.lang.*;

class Pisa
{ 
  public static void main (String[] args)
    throws Throwable
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
and we replace the <TT>GNUmakefile</TT> with the following one:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_TOOL_NAME = Pisa
Pisa_JAVA_FILES = Pisa.java
Pisa_PRINCIPAL_CLASS = Pisa

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java-tool.make
</PRE>
There are some differences with the <TT>GNUmakefile</TT> we use
before.  We include <TT>java-tool.make</TT> rather than
<TT>java.make</TT> because we want to create a Java tool rather than a
generic Java class.
<TT>JAVA_TOOL_NAME</TT> is the name of the tool - this is quite important 
now, because it is the name we will use to invoke the tool from the
command line: when you install the tool, GNUstep make will generate
and install a shell script in <TT>$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Tools</TT>
with that name (<TT>Pisa</TT> in this case), which runs your java
program (setting up the class path and the library path if needed).
So, once you have installed the Java tool, just typing <TT>Pisa</TT>
at the shell prompt will run your it.
<TT>JAVA_FILES</TT> are, as usual, the Java source files for the tool.  
<TT>PRINCIPAL_CLASS</TT> is the class which implements the <TT>main</TT> 
method - the GNUstep make package needs this information, so that it
can prepare the shell script to run this class.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00415000000000000000">
3.1.5 Documenting Classes Using Javadoc</A>
</H2>

<P>
The GNUstep make package has also some support for generating
documentation using <TT>javadoc</TT>; if you want to use this
facility, please read on.  Otherwise, you may safely skip this
section.

<P>
Here is an example of the usual <TT>GNUmakefile</TT> with added
documentation using javadoc:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = fun
fun_JAVA_FILES = \
  misc/quotes/Pisa.java       \
  misc/quotes/Farinata.java   \
  misc/quotes/Ulisse.java     \
  misc/jokes/Sailor.java      \
  misc/jokes/Worker.java

DOCUMENT_NAME = Reference
Reference_JAVADOC_FILES = misc.quotes misc.jokes
Reference_DOC_INSTALL_DIR = Developer/Fun/

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/documentation.make
</PRE>As you see, you need to choose a document name, list the packages you
want to document, choose the installation directory, and include
<TT>documentation.make</TT>.  We now review each option in more detail.

<P>
<TT>DOCUMENT_NAME</TT> is a name describing the documentation to be 
generated.  It has some importance, because the documentation is
generated inside a directory called <TT>$(DOCUMENT_NAME)</TT>.  In
this case, when I run <TT>make</TT>, make creates a directory called
<TT>Reference</TT>, and runs <TT>javadoc</TT> telling him to put 
the documentation into this directory (this is accomplished by using
the <TT>-d</TT> option to <TT>javadoc</TT>).

<P>
<TT>JAVADOC_FILES</TT> contains a list of packages to be documented.  
It might also contain standalone java files - which need to be
specified with full pathnames then, as in 
<PRE>
Reference_JAVADOC_FILES = /home/nicola/java/test/test.java
</PRE>
You can mix package names and java file names - and use an arbitrary
number of them.

<P>
<TT>DOC_INSTALL_DIR</TT> specifies where the generated documentation 
is going to be installed when you run <TT>make install</TT>.  In the
example, it will end up being installed in 
<PRE>
$(GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT)/Documentation/Developer/Fun/Reference/
</PRE>which on my system means
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/Local/Documentation/Developer/Fun/Reference/
</PRE>
Additional options you may want to use are: 

<OL>
<LI>Setting <TT>ADDITIONAL_JAVADOCFLAGS</TT> before including 
<TT>documentation.make</TT> allows you to pass custom 
flags to javadoc - a standard example is:
<PRE>
ADDITIONAL_JAVADOCFLAGS += -public
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>By default, the make package will tell javadoc to look for source 
files in the current directory; if some of them are elsewhere, you can
specify additional paths to look for the source files by setting a
<TT>JAVADOC_SOURCEPATH</TT>:
<PRE>
Reference_JAVADOC_SOURCEPATH=/home/nicola/Java/Nico:/home/nicola/Java/Nicola
</PRE>
Before running javadoc, the make package will always add <TT>./</TT> in 
front of the sourcepath - for example, in this case it would use 
<PRE>
-sourcepath ./:/home/nicola/Java/Nico:/home/nicola/Java/Nicola
</PRE>
when invoking javadoc.  Please refer to the javadoc documentation if
you want to learn more about the sourcepath.
</LI>
</OL>
