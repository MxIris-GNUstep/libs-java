3.1.1 Compiling a Single Class</A>
</H2>

<P>
Even without JIGS, the GNUstep make package has builtin support for
compilation of generic java projects.

<P>
As an example, consider the following java program: 
<PRE>
import java.lang.*;

class Pisa
{ 
  public static void main (String[] args) 
    throws Throwable
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
This program just prints out the famous quote by Dante about the
Italian city of Pisa; it makes only use of the standard java classes,
so there is no need to have JIGS to compile or run it.

<P>
Compiling this program can be quite easily done directly, but we want 
to start learning how to use the GNUstep make package facilities for 
java, so we write the following <TT>GNUmakefile</TT>:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = test
test_JAVA_FILES = Pisa.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>

<P>
The makefile is straightforward: the <TT>JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME</TT> is
just a name identifying the package (any name would do);
<TT>JAVA_FILES</TT> is a list of java files to be compiled.

<P>
You should now try to compile this java program by typing
<TT>make</TT>.  This - quite simply - compiles the java class.
What is more interesting is what happens when you type <TT>make
install</TT>: in this case, the java class is installed into
<TT>$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Libraries/Java/</TT>, which in my case means 
that the compiled class is installed into
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java/Pisa.class
</PRE>

<P>
Since the GNUstep initialization script - usually 
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
</PRE>
- adds <TT>/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java</TT> to the
<TT>CLASSPATH</TT>, after you have installed <TT>Pisa.class</TT>, you
can just type
<TT>java Pisa</TT> from any directory, and your little program will be run.

<P>
This can be unfortunate, because if you install many different
classes, you end up with all the classes being installed in the same
big flat messy directory.  The java approach to this is to use
packages, an approach which is fully and simply supported by the
GNUstep make package.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00412000000000000000">
3.1.2 Compiling Classes Belonging to a Package</A>
</H2>

<P>
To organize our java classes better, we decide to create a new
package, called <TT>misc.quotes</TT>, and to make our class part of
it.  To do this, we rewrite our program as follows
<PRE>
package misc.quotes;

import java.lang.*;

class Pisa
{ 
  public static void main (String[] args) 
    throws Throwable
  {
    System.out.println ("Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti");
  }
}
</PRE>
and we save it into the file 
<PRE>
misc/quotes/Pisa.java
</PRE>
This directory is relative to the position of the GNUmakefile, which
is where we will run the compiler.  We then rewrite our GNUmakefile to
be as follows:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = test
test_JAVA_FILES = misc/quotes/Pisa.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>
Typing <TT>make</TT> will compile the <TT>misc.quotes.Pisa</TT> class
as usual.

<P>
To execute the class, or to include it in other classes, we need now 
to always specify the full package name, as in (the command line command) 
<PRE>
java misc.quotes.Pisa
</PRE>
or as in (the java import statement)
<PRE>
import misc.quotes.Pisa;
</PRE>

<P>
The GNUstep Make Package knows nothing about java packages; but, when
installing java class files, it preserves the relative path of the
classes, so that running <TT>make install</TT> will install
<TT>Pisa.class</TT> into
<PRE>
$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Libraries/Java/misc/quotes/
</PRE>
In my case, this means that it is installed into:
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/Local/Libraries/Java/misc/quotes/Pisa.class
</PRE>

<P>
From any directory on your system you can now run your little program
by typing at the prompt <TT>java misc.quotes.Pisa</TT>.  The good
thing is that you can always import it as easily, by adding at the
beginning of your java code the line <TT>import
misc.quotes.Pisa;</TT>.

<P>
It is important to understand that the GNUstep make package does not
know about java packages, but just preserves the relative paths of the
classes when installing.  This means that it is perfectly correct to
compile and install classes belonging to different java packages with
the same <TT>GNUmakefile</TT>, as in the following example:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = fun
fun_JAVA_FILES = \
  misc/quotes/Pisa.java       \
  misc/quotes/Farinata.java   \
  misc/quotes/Ulisse.java     \
  misc/jokes/Sailor.java      \
  misc/jokes/Worker.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>

<P>
This will correctly compile and install the classes belonging to the
two different packages <TT>misc.quotes</TT> and <TT>misc.jokes</TT>;
please don't be confused by the <TT>JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME</TT> variable,
which bears no relation with java packages, and it is just a temporary
name used internally by the make package.
