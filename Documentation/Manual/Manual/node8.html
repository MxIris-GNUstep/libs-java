<P>
Accessing the GNUstep Base Library from your Java code is very easy.
The GNUstep Base Library classes are made available from Java as part
of the <TT>gnu.gnustep.base</TT> package.  If you have correctly
installed JIGS, this package has been installed as any other Java
package by the GNUstep Makefile package in your GNUstep directory
tree.  For example, on my system the GNUstep Base Library classes are
in:
<PRE>
/usr/GNUstep/System/Libraries/Java/gnu/gnustep/base/
</PRE>
To use the classes, it is enough to import them with the statement:
<PRE>
import gnu.gnustep.base.*;
</PRE>

<P>
As a simple example, here is a java program which reads the host name
using GNUstep, and prints it out:
<PRE>
import gnu.gnustep.base.*;

class PrintHostName
{ 
  public static void main (String[] args) 
    throws Throwable
  {
    NSProcessInfo process;

    process = NSProcessInfo.processInfo ();
    System.out.println (process.hostName ());
  }
}
</PRE>
We will comment in detail the code in the next section.

<P>
The GNUmakefile for this program is the usual, trivial, one:
<PRE>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME = PrintHostName
PrintHostName_JAVA_FILES = PrintHostName.java

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/java.make
</PRE>
This is probably a good moment to pause and try out this little
program on your system, to get a feeling of how simple and easy the
whole thing is.

<P>

3.2.2 The General Idea</A>
</H2>
The previous code example showed the basic idea behind the GNUstep
Java Interface: Java and Objective-C are very similar languages, so
that Objective-C classes can be exposed as Java classes nearly as they
are, with very little (if any) changings in the API.

<P>
In this example, the Objective-C class <TT>NSProcessInfo</TT> provided
by the GNUstep Base Library is exposed to Java as the Java class
<PRE>
gnu.gnustep.base.NSProcessInfo
</PRE>
Usually, classes in the same Objective-C library are exposed as
classes belonging to the same Java package; for example all classes in
the GNUstep Base Library are exposed as part of the
<TT>gnu.gnustep.base</TT> package, and all the classes in the GNUstep 
Gui Library are exposed as part of the <TT>gnu.gnustep.gui</TT>
package.

<P>
Both in Java and Objective-C there are class methods (called <I>static
methods</I> in Objective-C) and instance methods.  The interface
preservers both the name and the role of the Objective-C methods when
they are exposed to Java: static methods are made available as class
methods with the same name, and instance methods are made available as
instance methods with the same name.  This is the general plan - but
there are exceptions and pitfalls, because the languages differ in
some details - we will carefully study these exceptions and details
in the next sections.

<P>
In the example, the Objective-C static method <TT>processInfo</TT> is
accessible in Java as the class method <TT>processInfo</TT>; the
Objective-C instance method <TT>hostName</TT> is exposed as a Java
method <TT>hostName</TT>.

<P>
The only difference is in the syntax: in Objective-C you would write
<PRE>
NSProcessInfo *process;

process = [NSProcessInfo processInfo];
</PRE>
because this is the Objective-C syntax for method calls; in Java the 
same code is written as 
<PRE>
NSProcessInfo process;

process = NSProcessInfo.processInfo ();
</PRE>
because this is the Java syntax for method calls.

<P>
If you want to know exactly which classes and methods are exposed to
Java, with which name, and to which Objective-C classes and methods
they correspond, you can consult the quick reference documentation for
the GNUstep base library wrappers.  This is generated automatically by
JIGS when it creates the wrappers; if you have installed JIGS
correctly, it should be in:
<PRE>
$(GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT)/Documentation/Developer/Base/Java/Reference/
</PRE>Warning: this is only a quick reference for the java wrapper, listing
classes and methods exposed to Java, and does not document the GNUstep
Base Library itself.
