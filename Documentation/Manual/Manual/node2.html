1. What is JIGS</A>
</H1>

<P>
<I>JIGS</I> stands for <I>Java Interface for GnuStep</I>.  It is a package
allowing integration between Java and Objective-C.  The main purpose
of JIGS is to allow Java programmers to use the GNUstep libraries from
Java.

<P>
JIGS is more than a set of bindings for GNUstep from Java; JIGS takes
advantage of the fact that Objective-C and Java are very similar
languages to make it possible to use Objective-C classes from Java
using <B>exactly the same API</B> (and vice versa).  You have to learn
the GNUstep API only once, and then you can use it both from
Objective-C and from Java in the same way!  Moreover, JIGS can
generate automatically wrappers for your own Objective-C GNUstep
libraries.

<P>
JIGS allows you to write optimized classes and components in
Objective-C, and make them available to Java developers.  In the
typical configuration, fast Objective-C components and libraries are
used in the backend, and JIGS is used to integrate them smoothly in a
Java front-end.  Moving from one language to the other is as easy as
it can possibly be with two different languages.

<P>
JIGS is free software and part of the GNU project, freely available
from the Free Software Foundation under the GNU LGPL license.

<P>
This manual does not cover getting and installing JIGS; please refer
to the GNUstep web page for more information on getting and installing
JIGS.
