<H1><A NAME="SECTION00430000000000000000">
3.3 How the Wrapping Works</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this section, we review how the various Objective-C entities are
exposed to Java.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00431000000000000000">
3.3.1 Classes</A>
</H2>
Objective-C classes are usually exposed to Java with the same name
they have in Objective-C.  JIGS provides facilities to allow exposing
Objective-C classes with a different name to Java; it's better to
avoid it if possible.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00432000000000000000">
3.3.2 Methods</A>
</H2>
Not all Objective-C methods are exposed to Java; some methods can not
be exposed for obvious reasons (such as methods taking <TT>void *</TT>
arguments).  In general, methods taking pointer arguments (not
pointing to objects) or an arbitrary number of arguments (in the way 
the <TT>printf</TT> function does) are not exposed to Java.

<P>
Arguments and return types are automatically converted by the interface.

<P>
Methods without arguments are (usually) exposed as they are: for example, 
the <TT>NSProcessInfo</TT> method
<PRE>
- (NSString *) processName;
</PRE>
is exposed to Java as 
<PRE>
 public native String processName ();
</PRE>

<P>
Sometime, the name is changed.  JIGS allows to do this - but the less
it is done, the easier for the programmer.  Anyway sometimes it is
appropriate; for example, the GNUstep method <TT>description</TT>
(which can be invoked on any object to return a string describing the
object) is exposed to Java with the name <TT>toString ()</TT> (which
is the standard method for doing the equivalent job in the Java
world).  

<P>
In Objective-C, methods have their arguments introduced by
`<TT>:</TT>', as in the following example:
<PRE>
- (void) addObject: (id)anObject;
</PRE>
This method is accessible from Java as
<PRE>
public native void addObject (Object arg0);
</PRE>
The only difference is that in Java the argument is enclosed in 
brackets.

<P>
Things get more complicated if the method has multiple arguments.  In
Objective-C, each argument is introduced by a little string followed
by `<TT>:</TT>', as in the following example:
<PRE>
- (BOOL) writeToFile: (NSString *)fileName  
          atomically: (BOOL)flag;
</PRE>
In this example, <TT>fileName</TT> is the first argument, and
<TT>flag</TT> is the second one.  The method name is 
<PRE>
writeToFile:atomically:
</PRE>
The method is invoked as follows:
<PRE>
/* Objective-C example */
[array writeToFile: @"bar"  atomically: YES];
</PRE>

<P>
In Java, these methods are (usually) exposed by keeping only the first
part of the name (which is what comes before the first `<TT>:</TT>').
For example, <TT>writeToFile:atomically:</TT> is exposed as:
<PRE> 
public native boolean writeToFile (String arg0, boolean arg1);
</PRE>
and can be then invoked as follows:
<PRE>
/* Java example */
array.writeToFile ("bar", true);
</PRE>

<P>
It is possible that different Objective-C methods have a name which
begins in the same way, but differs in the next parts.  For example,
imagine that an hypothetical Objective-C class <TT>LocalizedArray</TT>
had both the method 
<PRE>
- (BOOL) writeToFile: (NSString *)fileName  
          atomically: (BOOL)flag;
</PRE>
and the method
<PRE>
- (BOOL) writeToFile: (NSString *)fileName  
          atomically: (BOOL)flag
          inLanguage: (NSString *)language;
</PRE>
This second method would translate all the entries of the hypothetical
array object into <TT>language</TT>, and then save it.

<P>
The methods would be exposed to Java as:
<PRE> 
public native boolean writeToFile (String arg0, boolean arg1);
public native boolean writeToFile (String arg0, boolean arg1, String arg2);
</PRE>
which causes no conflict, because Java allows overloading of methods,
and the two methods have a different Java signature.  It is worth to
remark here that the two methods are different in Objective-C because
their names are different, while they are different in Java because
their (name + Java signature)s are different.  This will be important
later in the discussion of selectors.

<P>
In rare cases, the conflict can't be escaped - JIGS allows the
programmer doing the wrapper to resolve the conflict by exposing one
of the two conflicting methods with a different name to Java.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00433000000000000000">
3.3.3 Constructors</A>
</H2>
In GNUstep, you create objects using <TT>alloc</TT>, followed by some
variant of <TT>init</TT>.  When you expose your class to Java, a
corresponding constructor is created for each
(<TT>alloc</TT> + <TT>init</TT>) pair.  

<P>
In short, for each Objective-C <TT>init</TT> method, the Java class
has a constructor.

<P>
Let us consider for example the <TT>NSArray</TT> class, which is
available in Java as the <TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSArray</TT> class.

<P>
In Objective-C, the class has the following <TT>init</TT> methods:
<PRE>
- (id) init;
- (id) initWithArray: (NSArray*)array;
- (id) initWithContentsOfFile: (NSString*)file;
- (id) initWithObjects: firstObj, ...;
- (id) initWithObjects: (id*)objects count: (unsigned)count;
</PRE>
The last two methods are not exposed to Java (the first one because it
takes an arbitrary number of arguments, which Java does not support;
the second one because it takes a pointer argument).

<P>
The corresponding Java class has the following constructors:
<PRE>
public NSArray ();
public NSArray (NSArray array);
public NSArray (String fileName);
</PRE>

<P>
For example, to create an array from the contents of the
<TT>array.debug</TT> file in my home directory, I would do:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
NSArray array = new NSArray ("/home/nicola/array.debug");
</PRE>

<P>
When two Objective-C <TT>init</TT> methods have different names but
arguments of the same type, it is of course impossible to expose both
of them to Java.  This case is rare and the only solution is to change
or extend the Objective-C API (or expose only one of the two).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00434000000000000000">
3.3.4 Primitive Types</A>
</H2>

<P>
Primitive types are mapped automatically by the interface.  For
example, an Objective-C method returning a <TT>BOOL</TT> (the
Objective-C type for boolean variables) will return a <TT>boolean</TT>
in Java.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00435000000000000000">
3.3.5 Strings</A>
</H2>

<P>
Strings are transparently <I>morphed</I> through the interface.  To
the end-user programmer, this simply means that Objective-C methods
having as argument (or returning) Objective-C <TT>NSString</TT>
objects take as argument (or return) in Java Java <TT>String</TT>
objects.

<P>
Internally, when the method is called, the interface generates on the
fly a GNUstep <TT>NSString</TT> object corresponding to the Java
<TT>String</TT> object, and passes it to Objective-C.  Viceversa, when
an Objective-C method returns a <TT>NSString</TT>, a Java
<TT>String</TT> object is generated on the fly from the returned string and
returned to Java.  This design is very comfortable for the programmer,
who always uses the string objects of the environment he is
programming in, but it is not very efficient.  This will only have an
effect on your program's performance if you pass very big strings -
and (or) a huge number of them - through the interface, while normally 
it doesn't make any appreciable difference in terms of performance.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00436000000000000000">
3.3.6 Numbers</A>
</H2>

<P>
Numbers (instances of <TT>java.lang.Number</TT> and subclasses) are
transparently morphed through the interface, in the same way as
strings are.  Again, this simply means that if an Objective-C method
takes as argument (or returns) an Objective-C <TT>NSNumber</TT>
object, the method in Java will take as argument (or return) a Java
<TT>Number</TT> object; the interface will automatically take care of
the conversion.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00436100000000000000">
3.3.6.1 Details of Number Mapping</A>
</H3>

<P>
This section explains the internals of the number morphing; it's quite
technical and for most people it's not really useful nor interesting,
so you may safely skip it at a first reading.

<P>
Internally, the situation is more complicated than in the case of
strings, because there are many public subclasses of
<TT>java.lang.Number</TT>, which hold considerably different types of
numbers each; and <TT>NSNumber</TT>, according to its Objective-C
type, can hold very different types of numbers as well.  

<P>
When the interface has to convert a Java <TT>Number</TT> object to an
Objective-C <TT>NSNumber</TT> object, it will check if the
<TT>Number</TT> object belongs to one of the standard Java number
classes (<TT>Byte</TT>, <TT>Short</TT>, <TT>Int</TT>, <TT>Long</TT>,
<TT>Float</TT>, <TT>Double</TT>); in this case, it will extract the
value of the number in the appropriate precision (for example, by
using <TT>byteValue</TT> for a <TT>Byte</TT>, or by using
<TT>longValue</TT> for a <TT>Long</TT>), and create a corresponding
<TT>NSNumber</TT> object with an Objective-C type which is big enough
to hold the value.  If the <TT>Number</TT> object instead is of a
non-standard class (such as a class you implemented), the interface
will extract the value of the number by using <TT>doubleValue</TT>,
and create a <TT>NSNumber</TT> object big enough to hold this double
value.  This can obviously result in loss of precision or conversion
problems if the Java number object is holding a value which can't be
represented with a double.

<P>
When, viceversa, the interface has to convert an Objective-C
<TT>NSNumber</TT> object into a Java <TT>Number</TT> object, it will
check the Objective-C type of the Objective-C object (only a finite,
documented number of number types are possible); it will extract the
value using the appropriate method (such as <TT>longValue</TT> is the
number is of type <TT>long</TT>), and create a Java <TT>Number</TT>
object of a standard class which can hold the value.

<P>
Please notice that an Objective-C <TT>NSNumber</TT> object can hold a
<TT>BOOL</TT> (boolean) value; this type is morphed into a small Java
<TT>Number</TT> object (usually a <TT>Short</TT>) holding <TT>0</TT>
for <TT>NO</TT>, and <TT>1</TT> for <TT>YES</TT>.  It can't be morphed
into a Java <TT>Boolean</TT> object, because in Java <TT>Boolean</TT>
objects are not numbers, and the whole point of morphing is that a
<TT>NSNumber</TT> is morphed exactly into a Java <TT>Number</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00437000000000000000">
3.3.7 Exceptions</A>
</H2>

<P>
Exception generated during calls to the GNUstep Objective-C code are
made available to Java as objects of the
<TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSException</TT> class.  This is a subclass of
<TT>java.lang.RuntimeException</TT>.  GNUstep Objective-C exception
usually have a <TT>name</TT> and a <TT>reason</TT>.  For example,
<TT>NSArray</TT>'s <TT>objectAtIndex ()</TT> method can generate an
exception if you ask for an object which lies past the end of the
array; in this case the name of the exception is
`<TT>NSRangeException</TT>', and the reason is `<TT>Index out of
bounds</TT>'.  Here is an example:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
NSArray array;
Object object;

array = new NSArray ();
try 
{
  /* Raises an exception because array is empty */
  object = array.objectAtIndex (5);
}
catch (NSException e)
{
  System.out.println ("Name is " + e.name ());
  System.out.println ("Reason is " + e.reason ());
  System.out.println ("Full Description is:" + e);
}
</PRE>
The example shows how to access the information about the GNUstep 
exception.  On my system, it prints:
<PRE>
Name is NSRangeException
Reason is Index out of bounds
Full Description is gnu.gnustep.base.NSException(NSRangeException):Index out of bounds
</PRE>

<P>
Many GNUstep methods can raise exceptions, even if these exceptions
are not declared in the Java method declarations (contrary to the Java
convention) because in Objective-C the exceptions raised by methods
are declared in the documentation, not in the code - so it's
important to understand that, when accessing GNUstep from Java, you
could need to use an exception handler for delicate parts of your code
even if your Java compiler does not force you to do so.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00438000000000000000">
3.3.8 Base Library Structs</A>
</H2>
The fundamental structs defined in the base library
<PRE>
NSRange, NSPoint, NSSize, NSRect
</PRE>
are exposed as the Java classes
<PRE>
gnu.gnustep.base.NSRange
gnu.gnustep.base.NSPoint
gnu.gnustep.base.NSSize
gnu.gnustep.base.NSRect
</PRE>
The important thing to understand is that you should think of objects
of these classes as C struct - that is, very lightweight objects
which are not meant to be subclassed (actually, you can't subclass
them at all, since they are <TT>final</TT>), and only act as a
container for information which you want to access and pass around as
fast as possible.  This is actually why they are structs and not
objects in the GNUstep Objective-C libraries in the first place.

<P>
We discuss here the case of <TT>NSPoint</TT>; the other cases are
completely similar.

<P>
Whenever an Objective-C method takes a <TT>NSPoint</TT> as argument,
the corresponding Java method takes a
<TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSPoint</TT> object as argument.  When the method 
is called, JIGS internally creates a struct (allocated on the stack so
it's fast) and initializes it with the <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>
coordinates stored in the Java <TT>NSPoint</TT> object; it passes this
struct as argument to the method call<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot493"><SUP>3.1</SUP></A>.

<P>
Whenever an Objective-C method returns a <TT>NSPoint</TT> (C struct),
the corresponding Java methods returns a Java <TT>NSPoint</TT> object.
When the method is called, JIGS converts the returned struct by
creating a corresponding Java <TT>NSPoint</TT> object, and returning
this object to Java.

<P>
To create an <TT>NSPoint</TT>, you just use the constructor
<TT>NSPoint (float x, float y)</TT>, as follows:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
NSPoint point;

point = new NSPoint (1, 1);
</PRE>
Once you have created a <TT>NSPoint</TT>, you can read and set its
<TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> coordinates directly, as in the following
example:
<PRE>
/* Java Example */
point.x = 5;
point.y = 4;
</PRE>
What is extremely nice in this approach is that you read and set the
coordinates of the point with <B>exactly</B> the same code you would
use in Objective-C:
<PRE>
/* Objective-C Example */
point.x = 5;
point.y = 4;
</PRE>

<P>
Some functionality which is provided by the GNUstep Base Library in
functions has been exposed as methods of the class
<TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSPoint</TT>.  This mainly includes:
<PRE>
public boolean isEqualToPoint (NSPoint aPoint);
public String toString ();
</PRE>
which provide the equivalent of the GNUstep Base Library functions
<PRE>
BOOL NSEqualPoints (NSPoint aPoint, NSPoint bPoint);
NSString *NSStringFromPoint (NSPoint aPoint);
</PRE>
Since <TT>gnu.gnustep.base.NSPoint</TT> is <TT>final</TT> (ie, it
can't be subclassed), your Java compiler should be able to inline all
the Java equivalent of these little functions, and they should be
reasonably fast.
