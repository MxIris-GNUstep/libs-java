JNI support functions
=====================

* Every JNI function returning a Java reference should return a local
  reference unless espressely stated otherwise.

* Every JNI function needing to create additional local references
  should push a reference frame upon entering, and pop it upon
  exiting.

* The result of any JNI call should be checked if needed.  Most JNI
  calls could raise Java exceptions - if that happens, the code should
  return to Java as soon as possible, where the exception can be
  handled.  The general policy is that any GSJNI support function
  returning a jobject, a jclass or a NSObject should return NULL or
  nil if and only if it has thrown an exception which is now pending.
