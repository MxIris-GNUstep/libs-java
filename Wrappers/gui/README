This wrapping is very experimental.
JIGS is still missing support for: 

 (*) protocols;
 (*) selectors;
 (*) custom types, defines;
 (*) constants;

All methods requiring these features can't be wrapped yet so are
commented out.  The resulting wrapping library works but is not very
useful yet because many key methods are missing.
