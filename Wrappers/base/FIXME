For completeness, the methods wrapped by hand need to be added to the class
selector map table, unless they are constructors.  TODO - modify the
WrapCreator tool to allow us to insert new methods in the table; do that for
all the hand made methods in this directory - which are -

NSData -bytes
NSArray -objects

(quite useless to have them in the table but anyway).
