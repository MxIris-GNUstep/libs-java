What is JIGS ?
==============

JIGS is a free (LGPL) Java Interface for GNUstep; it can automatically
wrap Objective-C libraries based on GNUstep making them accessible
directly to the Java programmer as if they were Java libraries.  As a
side effect, it is also possible to use the whole engine in the
reverse way: JIGS provides a high level API to allow Objective-C
programmers to start java virtual machines inside GNUstep Objective-C
code and access java objects in the java virtual machine
transparently, as if they were objective-C objects.

Authors

JIGS was brought to you by Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

Brainstorm Computer Solutions (http://www.brainstorm.co.uk) funded the 
development of JIGS.

Software Needed to Use JIGS
===========================

To use the JIGS, you need: 

  * A version of the Objective-C runtime library compiled as a shared
  library (and working with GNUstep).  Please refer to the INSTALL
  file for more information on how to compile and install it.  This is
  needed only to load objective-C libraries into a running java
  virtual machine, while you don't need it to start a java virtual
  machine inside an already running objective-C app or tool.  Please
  note that there are no examples yet of doing the latter in JIGS 
  though, so if you want to play comfortably, getting a shared
  Objective-C runtime library is recommended.

  * GNUstep make package and base library.

  * A java development environment supporting JNI 1.2.

Special Thanks
==============

To Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk> for countless
discussions and help during development of JIGS 0.1.

Obtaining JIGS
==============

JIGS is available at http://www.gnustep.it/jigs/Download/
New releases and snapshots can usually be found on the JIGS homepage, 
http://www.gnustep.it/jigs/.
You may always get the latest version of JIGS from the GNUstep CVS -
the module is called 'java'.
