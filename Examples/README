The Examples directory is mainly to people interested in JIGS internals.  

To start playing with JIGS as a programmer, you should instead: 
* go in the Wrappers directory (toplevel) and build, install the wrappers 
there
* go into the Testing directory (toplevel) and play there.

####

The directory Examples/ contains some examples of JIGS in action:

Examples/Java/ contains a couple of full examples of wrapping a GNUstep
objective-C library and accessing it transparently from java.  In these
examples, the wrapping has been done by hand.

Example/Java/SimpleGUI/ is and example of a gui library.  This example
contains detailed documentation (See Examples/Java/README).
