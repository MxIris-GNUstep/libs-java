This file documents how to package JIGS.

Packaging JIGS into RPM
=======================

All is ready for this.  All instructions start in the jigs top level
directory.

* To create an RPM for jigs

  Edit the jigs.spec.in file.
  su
  export RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat
  make rpm

  <replacing /usr/src/redhat with the top level dir of your RPM directory>

* To create an RPM for jigs-debug

  Edit the jigs-debug.spec.in file.
  su
  export RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat
  make debug=yes rpm

  <replacing /usr/src/redhat with the top level dir of your RPM directory>

* To create an RPM for gnustep-base-wrapper

  install the RPM for JIGS first

  cd Wrappers/base
  Edit the Wrappers/base/gnustep-base-wrapper.spec.in file
  su
  export RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat
  make rpm

* To create an RPM for gnustep-base-wrapper-debug

  install the RPM for JIGS first

  cd Wrappers/base
  Edit the Wrappers/base/gnustep-base-wrapper-debug.spec.in file
  su
  export RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat
  make debug=yes rpm


Packaging JIGS into DEB
=======================

I have no idea - I suppose we would really need a Debian maintainer to
take care of this.
