This is Wrap Creator.

Wrap Creator is an integrated tool to generate automatically 
java wrappers for an objective-C GNUstep library. 

USING WRAPCREATOR
=================

To wrap your preferite library to java using Wrap Creator, you need to: 

* compile and install WrapCreator;

* create a file LIBRARY_NAME.jigs (using your own library name) 
in your library directory; look at an Example how to create it 
(documentation forthcoming);  in future it will be also possible to use 
LIBRARY_NAME.jobs files in a format similar to the one used by Apple; 
they will be converted automatically to the .jigs format by a tool
before being processed.

* (optionally) create file GNUmakefile.wrapper setting the variable 
WRAPPER_HEADER to your library's main header file.  If you do not 
set this, it is guessed, so it could be necessary to set it;

* (optionally) create files GNUmakefile.wrapper.java.preamble, 
GNUmakefile.java.postamble, GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.preamble, 
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.postamble which will be copied as 
GNUmakefile.preambles and GNUmakefile.postambles in the wrapper 
library, java and objc parts.

* add the line `include java-wrapper.make' to your GNUmakefile, 
just after `include library.make'.

* type `make'.  This should create the java wrapper library code. 
If you have any problems (crash ?) at this stage, take a day to 
look into Wrap Creator sources and fix the problems - or send 
a detailed bug report to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.

* Go in the library wrapper directory (cd JavaWrapper).  Type `make'.
This should compile the library wrapper.  If you have problems at this
stage, they are generated or by some incorrect code generated by Wrap
Creator (please spot it out and report the bug); but it could also
simply be that you are linking to some exotic library etc; in this
case, you could typically need to use
GNUmakefile.wrapper.objc.preamble to set the appropriate flags to link
with the libraries.  *Any* library you use must be linked in using
LIBRARIES_DEPEND_UPON.  See the SimpleGUI example.

* At this stage, you may want to install you library, and the wrapper 
library.  To install the wrapper library (of course) type `make install' 
in it (you may need to become root).

* Whenever you want, you can delete the automatically generated wrapper 
library (rm -Rf JavaWrapper).  You should never touch anything manually 
inside the JavaWrapper directory, so that it can be safely removed by hand
without loosing anything worth.

COMPILING WRAPCREATOR
=====================

To compile WrapCreator, type: 

make

To install WrapCreator, become root, then type: 

make install

==

To try out WrapCreator, go into the Examples directory, 
then SimpleGUI, then in Library, then type 

make

[This will create the java wrapper library code automatically]

cd JavaWrapper
make 

[This will compile the java wrapper library]

cd ../../JavaApp
make

[This will compile the java application]

./run

[This will run the java app]
