INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To have the full functionality, you need to install a shared
Objective-C runtime library; the libobjc provided with older gcc is
static.  Please refer to the GNUstep website for more information on
installing a shared libobjc.

1) Make sure you have gnustep installed (optionally but strongly
   recommended - with a shared libobjc - such as the gnustep-objc),
   and that it is working.
   
2) Make sure your java environment is well configured.  
   At least one of the following should be true: 
  
  * typing 'javac' at the shell prompt should run the java compiler
  (ie, you have set up your PATH environment variable);

  * $JAVA_HOME or $JDK_HOME are set to the base of your java development
  environment distribution (so that for example javac would be located in
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac).  

[Please note that you may switch at any time to a different Java environment
simply by resetting the old shell variables to new values appropriate for
the new environment.  You do not need to recompile or reinstall JIGS nor any
GNUstep based java packages or apps.]

3) Compile JIGS: 

    make 

4) Install JIGS: Become root, then type:

    make install

5) Create and Compile the base library wrapper: Go into Wrappers/base
   (or into Wrapper/libFoundation if you are using libFoundation), and
   type:

   make

[Warning: you need to have installed JIGS (step 7) before you can
compile any wrapper]

6) Install the base library wrapper:  Become root, then type: 

   make install

7) Play with JIGS.  The best place to start is the Testing/Java
    directory.  See the README there for more info.
