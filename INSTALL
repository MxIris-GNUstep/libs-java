INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To have the full functionality, follow all the steps; in the
exceptional case that you don't need a shared objective-C runtime
library, you can safely skip points 0) to 4) to obtain a JIGS library
with reduced functionality.  I strongly suggest using a shared
objective-C runtime which gives you so much more possibilities of
having fun; the procedure is now explained in all details and it should 
be quite simple.  

0) Build and install the GNUstep make package. If you have already
   installed the GNUstep core libraries, you need to do nothing. 

1) Download one (and only one) of the following two packages providing a 
   shared libobjc: 

     * Helge Hess' shared Objective-C runtime library. This probably
       runs on many more platforms and machines than the other one. 
       Get it from 
       
       ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/contrib/libobjc-hh-20000417.tar.gz
       
     * If you prefer to use the standard Objective-C runtime library
       from gcc, here is the libobjc from the egcs-20000918 snapshot 
       packaged with a GNUmakefile. I hacked the machine configuration in, 
       so this probably only runs only on 32 bits machines (I tested it only 
       on a i386 linux-gnu), but it's precisely the latest gcc version. 
       Get it from 
       
       http://www.gnustep.it/jigs/libobjc.tgz


2) Compile the shared libobjc. Just get in the directory, and type 'make' 

3) Install the shared libobjc by typing 'make install'. This will
   install the shared libobjc in GNUstep's System directory. 

4) Reconfigure, recompile and reinstall the GNUstep core libraries.
   Reconfiguring them will detect that you have a custom libobjc in your
   GNUstep System directory, and always use that library and its headers when
   compiling GNUstep and all the stuff, ignoring the standard objective-C 
   runtime library bundled with your system.
   
5) Make sure your java environment is well configured.  
   At least one of the following should be true: 
  
  * typing 'javac' at the shell prompt should run the java compiler
  (ie, you have set up your PATH environment variable);

  * $JAVA_HOME or $JDK_HOME are set to the base of your java development
  environment distribution (so that for example javac would be located in
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac).  

[Please note that you may switch at any time to a different Java environment
simply by resetting the old shell variables to new values appropriate for
the new environment.  You do not need to recompile or reinstall JIGS nor any
GNUstep based java packages or apps.]

6) Compile JIGS: 

make 

7) Install JIGS: 

  * Become root, then type:

    make install

8) Play with JIGS.  The directory Examples/ contains examples of JIGS
in action.  You probably want to have a look at WrapCreator and its
examples, which you find in Tools/WrapCreator/.  The directory
Wrappers contains a first attempt at a wrapper for the gnustep base
library.
