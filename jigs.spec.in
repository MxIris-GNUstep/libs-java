%description
JIGS stands for Java Interface for GnuStep. It is a package allowing
integration between Java and Objective-C. The main purpose of JIGS is
to allow Java programmers to use the GNUstep libraries from Java.
JIGS is more than a set of bindings for GNUstep from Java; JIGS takes
advantage of the fact that Objective-C and Java are very similar
languages to make it possible to use Objective-C classes from Java
using exactly the same API (and vice versa). You have to learn the
GNUstep API only once, and then you can use it both from Objective-C
and from Java in the same way! Moreover, JIGS can generate
automatically wrappers for your own Objective-C GNUstep libraries.
